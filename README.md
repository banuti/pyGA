# pyGA
Genetic Algorithm (GA) in vanilla Python w/o libraries to see and study the inner workings.

Simple GA, so far with the toy problem to maximize the fitness function F(A,B).




findmax.py initializes the GA and runs the optimization, results are logged into external file pyGA.log.
pyGA.py provides the GA methods.
GAmath.py is a service file with functions for math operations.
GAparam.dat Parameters (here: A and B) are defined here. Name, upper and lower bound are required.
