# pyGA
Genetic Algorithm (GA) in vanilla Python w/o libraries to see and study the inner workings.

Simple GA, so far with the toy problem to maximize the fitness function F(A,B).



<p>
findmax.py initializes the GA and runs the optimization, results are logged into external file pyGA.log.<p>
pyGA.py provides the GA methods.<p>
GAmath.py is a service file with functions for math operations.<p>
GAparam.dat Parameters (here: A and B) are defined here. Name, upper and lower bound are required.<p>
